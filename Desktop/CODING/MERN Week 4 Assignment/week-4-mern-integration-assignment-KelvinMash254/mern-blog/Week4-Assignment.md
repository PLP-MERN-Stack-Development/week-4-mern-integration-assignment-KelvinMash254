# Week 4 MERN Stack Integration Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, you will build a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that demonstrates seamless integration between front-end and back-end components. The application will be a blog platform with full CRUD functionality, user authentication, and advanced features.

## Project Structure
Your project should follow the structure outlined below:

```

│   ├── utils/              # Utility functions
│   ├── server.js           # Main server file
│   └── package.json        # Server dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```
